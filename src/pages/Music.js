                <p>Nazriya Nazim Mebarak Ripoll was born on February 2, 1977, in Barranquilla, Colombia, to Nidia del Carmen Ripoll Torrado and William Alberto Mebarak Chadid. 
                          She is of Lebanese, Spanish, and Italian descent, contributing to her diverse musical influences. 
                          During her elementary school years, Shakira was diagnosed with ADHD, 
                          which mainly manifested as hyperactivity. 
                          She was known among her peers for her belly dancing skills. 
                          Despite her enthusiasm for music, she faced early criticism when a school choir teacher told her she wouldn't succeed because she "sang like a goat." 
                          These challenges did not deter her passion for music and performance. 
                          Shakira began her musical career at the age of 12, quickly gaining attention for her unique voice and energetic performances. 
                          Her breakthrough came with the album "MTV Unplugged," 
                          which won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2001, marking her rise to international prominence. 
                          Known for her fusion of Latin, rock, and Middle Eastern music styles, 
                          Shakira has created a distinctive sound that has garnered a global fan base. 
                          Her dynamic dance style, incorporating traditional belly dancing, further distinguishes her performances.</p>
